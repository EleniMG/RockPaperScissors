### What I have used:
- HTML
- CSS Flexbox and Grid
- Inline JavaScript


### What I have learned:
- Game logic
- Randomisation
- Using JavaScript methods to modify strings based on user's input
- Using innerHTML to modify content of HTML


### Improvements to be made:
- Placing choice and score messages on UI instead of alerts
- Account for spelling mistakes by the user
- Changing 'Start' button to 'Reset' or 'Stop'
